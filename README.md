# SierpinskiVisualization

This repository contains two implementations for visualizing Sierpiński fractals (Carpets and Gaskets):

- **python/**  
  Original code developed as part of a research project for the UW Madison Math 490 Undergraduate Seminar: *Invitation to Fractal Geometry* during the Spring 2023 semester. This implementation was included in the research paper attached.

- **kotlin_rewrite/**  
  A Kotlin/Gradle rewrite of the visualizer with a Compose-based desktop UI, created as a side project for further exploration of Sierpiński Carpets and Gaskets.

For detailed explanations, mathematical background, and the inspiration behind the project, please refer to the [research paper PDF](./SierpinskiVisualization_ResearchPaper.pdf).

Feel free to explore and experiment with either implementation!
